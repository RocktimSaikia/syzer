So, you want to contribute to this project! That's awesome. However, before
doing so, please read the following simple steps how to contribute. This will
make the life easier and will avoid wasting time on things which are not
requested. :sparkles:

## Discuss the changes before doing them

- First of all, open an issue in the repository, using the [bug tracker][1],
  describing the contribution you would like to make, the bug you found or any
  other ideas you have. This will help us to get you started on the right
  foot.

- If it makes sense, add the platform and software information (e.g. operating
  system, Node.JS version etc.), screenshots (so we can see what you are
  seeing).

- It is recommended to wait for feedback before continuing to next steps.
  However, if the issue is clear (e.g. a typo) and the fix is simple, you can
  continue and fix it.

## Fixing issues

- Fork the project in your account and create a branch with your fix:
  `some-great-feature` or `some-issue-fix`.

- Commit your changes in that branch. If the project contains tests (generally, the `test`
  directory), you are encouraged to add a test as well. :memo:

## Creating a pull request

- Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request
  message (e.g. _fixes #<*your-issue-number*>_). Write a good description and
  title, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.

- If it makes sense, add screenshots, gifs etc., so it is easier to see what
  is going on.

## Wait for feedback

Before accepting your contributions, we will review them. You may get feedback
about what should be fixed in your modified code. If so, just keep committing
in your branch and the pull request will be updated automatically.

## Everyone is happy!

Finally, your contributions will be merged, and everyone will be happy! :rocket:
Contributions are more than welcome!

Thanks! :tada: :smile:
